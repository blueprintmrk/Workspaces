<H1 id="top" class="title">Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt</H1>
<H2 class="subtitle2">The Definitive Guide to PyQt Programming<BR>by <I>Mark 
Summerfield</I></H2>
<H3 class="subsubtitle">ISBN-10: 0132354187&nbsp;–&nbsp;ISBN-13: 
978-0132354189</H3><!-- Body -->
<P>A <A href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0132354187">sample
 chapter</A> is available from InformIT—click "Sample Content" and then 
"Download the chapter" (almost at the bottom of the page).</P>
<P>This book teaches programmers how to write programs using PyQt&nbsp;4, the 
Python bindings for the Qt&nbsp;4 application development framework. PyQt&nbsp;4 
is probably the fastest and easiest route into GUI programming and works on 
Windows, Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, and most operating systems that use the 
X&nbsp;Window System, such as Linux and many Unices. Note that the book is also 
useful for <A href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html#pyside">PySide
 programmers</A>. (Be aware that from PyQt4.6, PyQt now has two slightly
 different APIs—but this only affects Python&nbsp;3 out of the box and doesn't 
affect Python&nbsp;2 users unless they want it to: see <A href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook.html#eg3">Downloads 
(Python&nbsp;3 Downloads)</A>.)</P>
<P>The book will be useful to people who program professionally as part of their 
job, whether as full-time software developers, or those from other disciplines, 
including <A href="http://www.pythonxy.com/">scientists and engineers</A>, who 
need to do some programming in support of their work. It is also suitable for 
students—the only prerequisite is basic knowledge of an object oriented 
programming language, for example, Java or C++, or of course Python itself.</P>
<P>The book is ~550 pages (648 including the appendices and index), has a
 foreword by Phil Thompson creator of PyQt, and is published by<A href="http://vig.prenhall.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0132354187,00.html">Prentice

<P>Part I is designed to quickly teach Python to non-Python programmers so that 
they can use the rest of the book. This part is also useful to Python 
programmers because it covers some of the non-GUI Qt classes, and some of the 
Python techniques that are often used in GUI programming, such as partial 
function application.</P>
<P>Most of the text is in Parts II, III, and IV. The chapters in these parts 
cover similar ground to my <A 
href="http://www.qtrac.eu/marksummerfield.html">C++/Qt books</A>, but have been 
written entirely from scratch with different examples and written from a totally 
PyQt&nbsp;4 perspective. Also, some topics are included that are not covered by 
my other books, for example, the rich text engine, and some more advanced 
model/view programming techniques.</P>

<H2 id="eg2">Downloads (Python 2.6 &amp; 2.7)</H2>
<P>Although the examples work fine with both Python&nbsp;2.5 and
 Python&nbsp;2.6, I've created Python&nbsp;2.6–specific versions that take some 
advantage of Python&nbsp;2.6's Python&nbsp;3–like features. The code is 
available in two formats, <A 
href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook26.tar.gz">pyqtbook26.tar.gz</A> (720K 
suitable for any platform), and <A 
href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook26.zip">pyqtbook26.zip</A> (926K Windows line 
endings) <FONT color="brown">[updated 2011-06-20]</FONT>. These examples have 
been tested on Linux with Python&nbsp;2.6 and PyQt&nbsp;4.4-4.6. Mac users 
please note that PyQt does not seem to be buildable with Python&nbsp;2.6 on 
Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, at least not for me and for some readers in the summer of 
2009, so Mac users are recommended to use Python&nbsp;2.5, or maybe try 
Python&nbsp;3! (I have now heard from one reader who has successfully got PyQt 
working with Python&nbsp;2.6 on his Mac. Essentially what he did was to change 
the<TT>/usr/locale/Qt4.6/mkspecs/default</TT> symbolic link to point directly to 
the compiler rather than Xcode—in his case to<TT>macx-g++40</TT>. In fact, since 
he was on a PowerPC rather than an x86-based Mac he also had to modify the 
<TT>qconfig.pri</TT> file's<TT>QT_CONFIG</TT> statement to remove <TT>x86</TT>. 
He then unpacked the PyQt Mac tarball and did the usual installation process and 
it worked. I haven't tried this myself and don't plan to—I'm switching 
exclusively to using Python&nbsp;3 now.)</P>
<H2 id="eg3">Downloads (Python 3.<I>x</I>)</H2>
<P>From PyQt4.6, PyQt has <I>two</I> APIs, API#1 (the original), and API#2 
(new). API#2 is more Pythonic and eliminates <TT>QString</TT> and 
<TT>QVariant</TT>, and is a bit nicer to use. API#1 remains best for those using 
PyQt to prototype C++/Qt applications. API#1 is the default for PyQt4.<I>x</I> 
with Python&nbsp;2.<I>x</I>, and for PyQt4.0-4.5 with Python&nbsp;3.<I>x</I>, 
and is the API used by PySide. API#2 is the default for PyQt4.6+ with 
Python&nbsp;3.<I>x</I>. The book uses API#1, but the differences are not too 
big. Basically, most of the changes affect uses of <TT>QDataStream</TT>,
<TT>QSettings</TT>, and <TT>QTextStream</TT>, and of course any use of
<TT>QString</TT> methods (since in API#2, <TT>QString</TT> is gone, so we use 
<TT>str</TT>). </P>
<P>Versions of the examples for Python&nbsp;3.0 and PyQt&nbsp;4.5.1 using API#1
 are available in the usual two formats, <A href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook3.tar.gz">pyqtbook3.tar.gz</A> 
(718K suitable for any platform), and <A href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook3.zip">pyqtbook3.zip</A> 
(920K Windows line endings) <FONT color="brown">[updated 2010-07-21]</FONT>. The
 examples have also been ported to Python&nbsp;3.1 and PyQt&nbsp;4.7.3 using 
API#2: <A href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook31.tar.gz">pyqtbook31.tar.gz</A> 
(723K suitable for any platform), and <A href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook31.zip">pyqtbook31.zip</A> 
(918K Windows line endings)<FONT color="brown">[updated 2010-08-24]</FONT>. Note 
that both sets of Python&nbsp;3 examples are straight conversions of the book's 
original examples and don't take any specific advantage of Python&nbsp;3 or
 PyQt&nbsp;4.5 (or later) features, except for using<TT>str.format()</TT> rather 
than the <TT>%</TT> operator. The API#2 versions don't always match up with the 
examples in the book (because the book uses API#1), but as already noted, the 
differences aren't huge and only affect a few specific classes.</P>
<H2 id="pyside">PySide Porting</H2>
<P>PySide is highly compatible with PyQt. However, I have not released PySide 
versions of the book's examples because I haven't had time to complete porting 
them. If you want to use the book's examples with PySide I strongly recommend 
that you start from the <A 
href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook31.tar.gz">pyqtbook31.tar.gz</A> (723K
 suitable for any platform), or <A 
href="http://www.qtrac.eu/pyqtbook31.zip">pyqtbook31.zip</A> (918K Windows line 
endings) archives since PySide uses API#2 which is what the examples in these
 archives use.</P>
<P>To convert any particular example to PySide the steps are as follows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Replace <TT>python3</TT> in the first line with <TT>python</TT>.</LI>
  <LI>Add the following statements before the first import:<TT><PRE>from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function
from future_builtins import *
</PRE></TT>
  </LI>
  <LI>Replace <TT>PyQt4</TT> with <TT>PySide</TT> throughout (e.g., in the
   imports)</LI>
  <LI>If using Python&nbsp;2.6 replace <TT>{}</TT> in format strings with
  <TT>{0}</TT>, <TT>{1}</TT>, etc., as appropriate.</LI>
  <LI>Add <TT>[0]</TT> at the end of every <TT>QFileDialog.*()</TT>function 
  call. (In PyQt these return a—possibly empty—filename; in PySide they return a 
  filename–filter 2-tuple, but all the examples only need the filename.)</LI>
  <LI>Replace <TT>QT_VERSION_STR</TT> with <TT>qVersion()</TT>.</LI>
  <LI>Replace <TT>PYQT_VERSION_STR</TT> with <TT>PySide.__version__</TT>; you 
  will also need to add <TT>import PySide</TT> in the imports after the future 
  imports.</LI>
  <LI>Replace <TT>@pyqtSignature</TT> with <TT>@Slot</TT>.</LI>
  <LI>Replace <TT>def isAlive(qobj): ...</TT> with <TT>def isAlive(qobj): return 
  True</TT>. (There is currently no PySide equivalent.)</LI>
  <LI>Replace <TT>chr</TT> with <TT>unichr</TT>.</LI></UL>
<P>These conversions are sufficient in most cases. However, a few of the
 examples' behavior is not correct even after these changes. And unfortunately, 
I don't have the time to investigate.</P>
<P>For more information on the tools the book teaches see the <A href="http://www.python.org/">Python
